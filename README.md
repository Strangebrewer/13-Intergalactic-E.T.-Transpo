### 1-Description
This project uses Google Firebase and Moment.js to store data on fictional (or are they?) intergalactic vessels and keep track of the arrivals and departures. It's a scheduling app that could be adapted to tracking more realistic events and appointments, or even something like a train schedule.


### 2-Technologies
  This project utilizes the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### 3-Challenges
The primary challenges of this project were Firebase and Moment.js. In particular, getting the times to update regularly was a challenge. As with so many learning experiences in coding, in retrospect all of it seems easy. Learning to make transparent allowed for an interesting header with a gif behind it for added effect.
