# Intergalactic E.T. Transpo

This project uses Google Firebase and Moment.js to store data on fictional (or are they?) intergalactic vessels and keep track of the arrivals and departures. It's a scheduling app that could be adapted to tracking more realistic events and appointments, or even something like a train schedule. You can check it out [here](https://strangebrewer.github.io/Bootcamp-11-Intergalactic-E.T.-Transpo/).
